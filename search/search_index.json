Important Links Homepage Privacy Policy Terms of Service Support Server Tutorial Now, lets go over a tutorial. You might notice the /login command, but that will only redirect you to an oauth2 link , so we can just go straight there. Once you authorize the bot, it should say successfully linked. And thats essentially it, you've linked your account. Now you can run /crosschat start and your crosschat should start. To stop it, run /crosschat stop . This uses the default settings, and I will go more in-depth with settings in the settings section. Crosschat Settings When you run the /settings command, you get the ability to configure (whatever you can really) but the most is either your crosschat settings or server notifications. I will talk about the crosschat settings here. You can see the notification section for info about that Switching between embeds/webhooks: When you send a message on twitch, the bot checks your configuration to see if it should send the message to discord through a webhook, or a normal message with an embed. This setting lets you change which the bot does. It's a simple toggle Allow Guests To Chat: Allowing them to talk disables Guest-Only mode , while not letting them talk enables Guest-Only mode . Edit Blacklist Settings: This lets you blacklist a discord/twitch user, or unblacklist them. You can read more about blacklisting here Edit Whitelist Settings: This lets you Whitelist a discord/twitch user, or Whitelist them. Also lets you toggle if it's enabled or not. You can read more about whitelisting here Edit Directional Settings: Directional Settings will let you choose which way messages are sent. By defualt it is set to both directions for crosschat, but you can change that. Premium Settings These features require you to be a premium member Toggle Autoreconnect: When the bot restarts, normally you have to manually run /crosschat start again. But with this, the bot will automatically reconnect. This is once again another simple toggle. Edit Embed Format: When the bot sends an embed to discord, this setting lets you change how the embed is displayed. It gives you an interactive embed creater which lets you form it, then visualize it with test data. This setting supports variables Edit Webhook Format: Currently, this only lets you change the way the bot generates the webhook's username. This setting supports variables Profiles Want to view someone else's profile? Well you can run /profile to do so. This will show you their twitch account, crosschat settings, blacklisted and whitelisted users, and their statistics. Notifications When you run the /settings command, you get the ability to configure (whatever you can really) but the most is either your crosschat settings or server notifications. I will talk about the server notifications here. You can see the crosschat settings section for info about that Restart Notifications: When a restart gets scheduled, the bot will notify you. It will also notify you once it's done starting, and when it just normally comes online. Update Notifications: When the bot recieves an update, it will send a message which contains the main highlights, along with a link that contains the full changelog. When you change the channel, it will delete the old record so you can only have 1 per server. Variables Some settings support variables, and to sum up what that means is like this: lets say {test} is a variable. The bot would replace {test} with what the variable will be. Once example is {username} , which will be replaced with the users username. All of the bots variables are like so: {variable_name} Fields that support variables: All fields in embed format Webhook title Variable Index: username - the chatters username display_name - the chatters display_name content - the message's content profile_picture - the url of the chatter's profile picture user_id - the chatters id Auto-Disconnect After an hour of no messages being sent through your crosschat, it will be automatically disconnected. Want this disabled? premium users get this disabled, along with access to an autoreconnect feature. Blacklist Blacklisting is a feature which allows you to block messages being sent through your crosschat. When you block a discord user, any messages sent from them will not be sent from twitch. When you block a twitch user, no messages from that user will be sent to discord. Whitelist Whitelisting is a feature which allows you to choose who's messages get sent through your crosschat. You can choose to whitelist discord or twitch users, and toggle if discord whitelist (or twitch) is enabled/disabled independently. Guest-only mode With this enabled, the only way for someone to talk in your crosschat is if they link their discord and twitch accounts through ChatToTwitch.

You probably think I added this so more people would buy premium, and although that is one perk of this, it's not the reason. This is here so it's more accurate to figure out how many crosschats are currently active, which will help me do restarts during downtime hours, etc. Better message parsing (Ex: when sending a message to discord, emojis, commands, roles, member, and channel mentions will all be stripped down to make it more readable.) Reply support (Messages will now display the content and author of the message they are replying to) Statistics. Using the /about command will let you see global statistics, while using /profile will let you see user-specific statistics. To maintain a minimilistic view, the ping command has been switched to a prefix command. The prefix is the bots mention, so it would be invoked as such: @ChatToTwitch ping /crosschat start will now give you warnings if you have settings enabled that could deteriorate the preformance of the bot.
